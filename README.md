# summarize-process-sample
Combines similar threads in a macOS process sample or spindump, and outputs a summary.  When debugging massively-multithreaded apps, this could help trim down these reports into something readable.

Usage:

    sample [some-process] | summarize-process-sample

Example output:

    Sampled 236 threads

This indicates that of this process sample's 236 threads, over half of them are individually waiting on kernel events â€” that's possibly an excessive number of kernel event queues.
